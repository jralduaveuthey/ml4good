        "# W3D2 - Part 2 - DQN Algorithm\n",
        "\n",
        "In this section, you'll implement Deep Q-Learning, often referred to as DQN for \"Deep Q-Network\". This was used in a landmark paper [Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf).\n",
        "\n",
        "At the time, I was very excited about this paper - the idea that convolutional neural networks could look at Atari game pixels and \"see\" gameplay-relevant features like a Space Invader was new and noteworthy. In 2022, we take for granted that convnets work, so we're going to focus on the RL aspect and not the vision aspect today.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Fast Feedback Loops\n",
        "\n",
        "We want to have faster feedback loops, and learning from Atari pixels doesn't achieve that. It might take 15 minutes per training run to get an agent to do well on Breakout, and that's if your implementation is relatively optimized. Even waiting 5 minutes to learn Pong from pixels will limit your ability to iterate relative to environments that are as simple as possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "## CartPole\n",
        "\n",
        "The classic environment \"CartPole-v0\" is simple to understand, yet hard enough for a RL agent to be interesting. [Here's a video of a RL agent playing CartPole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46wjA6dqxOM); by the end of the day your agent will be able to do this and more!\n",
        "\n",
        "You can see the source for CartPole [here](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/classic_control/cartpole.py); don't worry about the implementation but do read the documentation to understand the format of the actions and observations.\n",
        "\n",
        "The simple physics involved would be very easy for a model-based algorithm to fit, but today we're doing it model-free: your agent has no idea that these observations represent positions or velocities, and it has no idea what the laws of physics are.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each environment can have different versions registered to it. By consulting [the Gym source](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/__init__.py) you can see that CartPole-v0 and CartPole-v1 are the same environment, except that v1 has longer episodes. Again, a minor change like this can affect what algorithms score well; an agent might consistently survive for 200 steps but not be stable out to 500 steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Beyond CartPole\n",
        "\n",
        "If things go well and your agent masters CartPole, the next harder challenges are [Acrobot-v1](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/classic_control/acrobot.py), and [MountainCar-v0](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/classic_control/mountain_car.py). These also have discrete action spaces, which are the only type we're dealing with today. Feel free to Google for appropriate hyperparameters for these other problems - in a real RL problem you would have to run a hyperparameter search using the techniques we learned on a previous day because bad hyperparameters in RL often completely fail to learn, even if the algorithm is perfectly correct.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many more exciting environments to play in, but generally they're going to require more compute and more optimization than we have time for today. If you finish the main material, some ones I like are:\n",

For example, in a chess game if you happen to be far ahead in pieces, for the rest of the game most actions will have a much higher than average expected reward. Even bad moves will have a high reward if they aren't bad enough to cause you to actually lose.

        "\n",
        "The capacity of the replay buffer is yet another hyperparameter; if it's too small then it's just going to be full of recent and correlated examples. But if it's too large, we pay an increasing cost in memory usage and the information may be too old to be relevant.\n",
